+You are auditing and fixing a Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI "Foundry" repo so the local runner and RAG chat work end-to-end.
+
+## SCOPE
+- Verify and repair: file structure, imports/aliases, ts-node + ESM config, env loading, Supabase admin client, runner loop, API routes, and scripts.
+- Do not introduce frameworks or major refactors; keep minimal, working defaults.
+- Make changes directly and show unified diffs in your final report.
+
+## ACCEPTANCE TESTS
+1) `node --loader ts-node/esm src/runner.ts` starts, polls Supabase without TypeErrors, and idles when no jobs exist.
+2) `npm run dev` serves `/dashboard/mission-control`, RAG chat responds, and launching a mission enqueues a job in `autonomous_jobs`.
+3) With the runner running, a queued job flips to `completed` (or `failed`) and status polling in the UI shows the terminal state.
+
+## NON-NEGOTIABLES
+- Fix path alias resolution so imports compile in Next.js and runner.
+- Runner must work locally without Vercel.
