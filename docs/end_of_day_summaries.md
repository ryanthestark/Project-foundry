# Project Bruno – End of Day Briefings

Prepared: **{Today’s Date}**

---

## **Section 1 – CEO Briefing (Approx. 4 Pages)**

### **1. Where We Started**
Project Bruno began with an initial vision captured in **bootstrap.json**: to eliminate the friction of juggling multiple AI tools by creating a unified, persistent, intelligent assistant UI, inspired by "Things-like" minimalism but enhanced with AI features.

The project fuses **two pillars**:
1. **Family OS** – A mobile-first, PWA-ready productivity and engagement platform for families.
2. **AI Swarm Foundry** – A meta-layer for rapidly creating niche AI-driven SaaS products, with RAG and multi-agent orchestration at its core.

Initially the concept was to improve our personal workflow — capturing tasks, orchestrating AI councils for brainstorming and decision-making, and logging documentation — but evolved into a family-wide and business-facing platform.

From the first commits, key architectural decisions were:
- **Serverless-first**, hosted on Vercel, with Next.js for PWA support.
- **Supabase** for authentication (including Google Auth), a Postgres DB with Row-Level Security (RLS), and file storage.
- **OpenRouter** for AI model access (avoiding lock-in to just OpenAI).
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for ingesting and searching domain-specific documents.
- **Multi-model AI Council** for collaborative, multi-agent prompt execution.

---

### **2. Where We Are Now**
**Core Features Implemented:**
- ✅ **Authentication** – Email/password and Google OAuth.
- ✅ **Responsive Dashboard** – Mobile PWA with sidebar & bottom navigation.
- ✅ **Supervisor Chat** – Multi-mode (Supervisor, Aider Build, RAG Research) with:
  - Voice input via Web Speech API.
  - Optional image uploads.
  - Integrated RAG context retrieval.
- ✅ **AI Todo / Tasks** – Secure, authenticated CRUD API tied to `family_id`.
- ✅ **Document Upload** – For ingestion into RAG knowledge base.
- ✅ **Film Studio (Kids)** – AI-generated scripts, props, and scene ideas.
- ✅ **Daily Journal API** – Mood & habit tracking.
- ✅ **Cost Tracking** – Display API usage costs.
- ✅ **Git Push Button** – Deploy-from-dashboard (MVP version operational).
- ✅ **Autonomous Mission Runner** – Executes queued "missions" using Aider CLI.
- ✅ **RAG Tooling** – Python CLI to ingest & retrieve documents with embeddings.

**UI/UX:**
- Themes, animation, and layouts optimized for **iPhone in Chrome** and still impressive on desktop.
- PWA installable with app-like navigation.
- One dashboard interface for both user 0 and user 1, with logical feature separation.
- Family-friendly expansion (Film Studio) to onboard all family members.

**Backend Stability:**
- All CRUD APIs tested for tasks, journal, and council functions.
- RAG functions tested end-to-end: ingestion → match_knowledge_base_chunks → retrieval in Supervisor Chat.

### **3. Business Strategy**
Referencing **docs/project_bruno_business_strategy.md**:

**Primary Goal:** Hybrid MRR model to reach $300-500k/year in 12 months:
1. **Family OS Premium** ($12/mo per family; $120/year).
2. **B2B Orgs** ($500–$2,500/mo) for group deployments.
3. **SaaS Micro-Apps (Foundry)** – Launch multiple $29–$199/mo products.
4. **Consulting Services** ($15k–$50k engagements) – Immediate cash-flow bridge.
5. **Licensing/White-label** RAG/swarm backend to partners.
6. **Acquisition Flips** – Build/acquire and sell micro-apps to larger SaaS.

**Consulting GTM Plan:**
- 4-week sprint to land ≥ 2 clients or pivot to high-comp W2.
- Target niches: SMBs in compliance-heavy verticals, SaaS startups, EdTech.
- Delivery: AI integrations, RAG setups, agent development, audits.

### **4. Financial Projections**
**Years 1–2 Quarterly Projections** (MRR + Consulting):
| Quarter | B2C MRR | B2B MRR | Foundry MRR | Consulting | Total Quarterly Revenue |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Q1 Y1 | $3.6k | $3k | $0 | $60k | $199.8k |
| Q4 Y1 | $15k | $12k | $4.5k | $60k | $274.5k |
| Q4 Y2 | $45k | $24k | $16k | $10k | $285k |

**Years 3–5 Annual ARR Targets:**
- Y3: $1.6M
- Y4: $2.95M
- Y5: $5M (exit at $25–50M possible).

---

### **5. Key Risks & Next Steps**
**Risks:**
- Consulting conversion rate uncertain; runway depends on initial client projects.
- Need to ensure robust data privacy for family/consulting clients.
- Balance between family feature dev and consulting delivery.

**Next Steps Prior to Launch:**
- Complete consulting sales page and outreach collateral.
- Close first consulting deal in 2 weeks.
- Polish PWA offline cache, push testing.
- Ensure all RAG ingestion can be triggered via UI.
- Final smoke test per **docs/launch_checklist.md**.

## **Section 2 – Spouse Briefing (Approx. 2 Pages)**

### **Our Starting Vision**
We wanted an app that helps organize both our family life and our business ideas, adding AI to take over the repetitive and hard thinking tasks:
- Family gets chores/rewards system.
- We get AI help on coding, planning, and research.
- Everything connects so tasks, ideas, and research all stay together.

### **What We Have Now**
- Works on your iPhone like a normal app.
- You (and kids) can:
  - Chat with AI across different modes.
  - Do voice-to-text requests.
  - Upload pictures to ask AI about them.
  - Add personal or shared tasks.
  - Write in a journal or log moods.
  - Use Film Studio to get AI-created movie scripts & prop lists.
- I can:
  - Use the AI Council to get multiple AI model answers at once.
  - Kick off automated builds via Aider Bot (developer helper).
  - Upload documents and have them become searchable knowledge.

### **Why It Matters**
- The more you and the kids use it, the smarter it gets (RAG context-building).
- Family OS can become a side business — either via subscriptions or licensing.

### **Next Steps for You**
- Try Film Studio with the kids.
- Test journaling once a day.
- Add 2–3 tasks into the task list each week.
- Give feedback on app layout/what’s confusing.

## **Section 3 – Kids’ Briefing (Approx. 1 Page)**

### **Movie Makers’ New Tool!**
The app now has a **Film Studio** section where **you can**:
- Write down your movie idea.
- Press a button to get:
  - A story outline.
  - Which props you need.
  - Fun scene ideas.
  - Surprise twists for your movie.

You can *act it out*, use costumes, or film it on the iPad!
  
### **Other Cool Things in the App:**
- Ask the AI questions or tell it to make up a game.
- Add your to-dos (like "clean room" or "feed pet").
- Tell the app with your voice what you want it to remember.

### **Goal:**
- Have FUN.
- Help Mom and Dad by using the app so it learns and grows.
- Show us your best movies so we can use the projector for family night!
