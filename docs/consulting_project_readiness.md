# Consulting Project Readiness & Human Validation Plan

**Date:** 2025‚Äë08‚Äë11  
**Prepared by:** AI Swarm Strategy Team

## 1. Purpose

This document consolidates technical, product, and business readiness information to define **exactly** what is needed for Project Bruno to move into the **consulting engagement phase** ‚Äî ready to prospect and onboard clients.

It is based on:
- `docs/project_bruno_feature_summary.md`
- `docs/situation_report.md`
- Source files for implemented features
- Observations from current UI & API status

---

## 2. Core Deliverable for Consulting

Before selling consulting services using this stack, **we must present a stable, functional system** with:
1. **Fully demonstrable features** relevant to target clients.
2. **Zero critical defects** in any supported workflow.
3. **Business packaging** ‚Äî documentation, value proposition, and pricing.

---

## 3. System Feature Readiness

### ‚úÖ Fully Working & Verified
- **AI Council & Prompt Synthesis** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx` + `/api/synthesize/...`) ‚Äî Multi-model prompt synthesis with real-time updates.
- **Mission Runner Automation** (`run_missions.sh`) ‚Äî End-to-end mission playback with session logging.
- **RAG Retrieval** (`rag_retrieval_tool.py`, `/api/rag_retrieval`) ‚Äî Semantic doc search works and returns usable context.
- **Document Ingestion** (`ingest_docs_to_supabase_rag.py`) ‚Äî Markdown upload with OpenRouter embeddings into Supabase.
- **AI-Driven Todo List (Tasks)** (`app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx`, `/api/tasks`) ‚Äî Authenticated CRUD works with `family_id` linkage.
- **Telemetry & Knowledge Graph** ‚Äî Fully functional Supabase schemas and retrieval.
- **Supabase Auth & Middleware** ‚Äî Session persistence tested across browser and API routes.

### ‚ö† Needs Human UI/UX Validation
- **Reward Store** ‚Äî API exists (`/api/rewards`), but `/dashboard/rewards` page is missing or 404s.
- **Film Studio** ‚Äî Placeholder UI/endpoint; needs backend integration.
- **Profile Page** ‚Äî Link and component exist, but requires human validation of update flows.

### üöß Planned But Not Implemented
- Real-time Points & Leaderboard
- Journaling & Mood UI
- Family Hub onboarding flow (multi-child support, avatar selection)

## 11. Revenue Ramp Projection

With the **AI Council Insight Hub** and **Autonomous Knowledge Assistant** as lead offers, the path to **$25,000‚Äì$35,000 net revenue** can be achieved quickly by focusing on high‚Äëvalue, short‚Äëcycle deals.

### Baseline Assumptions
- **Price Points:**
  - AI Council Insight Hub: $6,000 average
  - Autonomous Knowledge Assistant: $6,500 average
- **Cost Base:** Lean delivery team with minimal subcontracting; ~20‚Äì25% delivery cost on fixed‚Äëprice engagements.
- **Close Rate:** 20% from warm outreach / active interest.
- **Sales Cycle:** 2‚Äì3 weeks from first call to payment.

### Revenue Scenarios
| Deals | Mix Example | Gross Revenue | Est. Delivery Cost (25%) | Net Revenue |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 3 deals | 2 √ó Hub + 1 √ó Assistant | $18,500 | $4,625 | $13,875 |

| 6 deals | 3 √ó Hub + 3 √ó Assistant | $38,000 | $9,500 | $28,500 |

---

### Fastest Route to $25k‚Äì$35k Net
1. **Target 4‚Äì6 signed projects** in the first 6‚Äì8 weeks.
2. Prioritize **existing networks** and **referrals** for warm leads to compress sales cycle.
3. Run **back‚Äëto‚Äëback delivery** in parallel:  
   - Example: Start 2 Hub deployments immediately, begin 2 Assistant deployments 1 week later.
   - Staggered schedule maximizes margin without overloading team.
4. Use **paid discovery workshops** ($2k each) as low‚Äëbarrier entry; upsell to full package.  
   - Even 3 workshops converting at 66% yields ~2 additional full packages.

---

**Conclusion:**  
With aggressive outbound targeting, use of the demo environment, and parallelized delivery, the $25k‚Äì$35k net revenue target is **reachable in ~8 weeks** and can be accelerated to ~6 weeks if 4 deals close in the first month.
