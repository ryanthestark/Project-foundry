# Project Bruno: A Complete Handoff and Strategic Briefing

**To:** AI Conductor
**From:** Lead Researcher Aider
**Date:** 2025-08-04
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Executive Summary

This document serves as the single source of truth for Project Bruno. Its primary goal is to create a stable, autonomous multi-agent AI software development team, referred to as the "Aider Swarm." The project aims to enable a human Supervisor to operate at a strategic level, delegating implementation tasks to a swarm of specialized AI agents.

The project has successfully moved past a critical stabilization phase and is now focused on feature development. The "Pilot V1" mission is currently running autonomously, orchestrated by the `run_missions.sh` script.

The immediate next step for the Supervisor is to monitor the progress of this ongoing autonomous mission and intervene only if critical errors arise.

## 2. The "Why": Project Philosophy and Strategic Vision

The core motivation for Project Bruno is to fundamentally change the paradigm of software development. We are building a system where a human acts as a strategic commander, defining high-level goals and missions, while an AI team handles the full development lifecycle. This elevates the human role from micromanagement and debugging to pure strategy and product vision.

The long-term vision is a fully autonomous software development agency managed by a "Conductor Aider," capable of taking a business goal and translating it into a shipped software product with minimal human intervention.

## 3. The "How": Methodology and Core Components

Our methodology is built on a few key components that enable the Aider Swarm to operate autonomously.

*   **The Aider Swarm:** A team of specialized AI agents, each with a distinct role:
    *   **Architect Aider:** Designs high-level system architecture, database schemas, and defines the technical contracts between services.
    *   **Researcher Aider:** Creates functional specifications, strategy documents, and market analysis based on high-level goals.
    *   **Designer Aider:** Produces UI/UX mockups and visual designs based on functional specifications.
    *   **Engineer Aider:** Writes, debugs, and implements code based on the specifications and mockups provided by the other Aiders.

*   **The Mission Manifest (`missions.json`):** This file is the heart of the autonomous system's work queue. It is a JSON array where each object represents a single, sequential mission. Each mission object contains:
    *   `aider_name`: The specialized Aider tasked with the mission.
    *   `branch_name`: The base name for the Git branch the Aider will work on.
    *   `prompt_file`: The path to a text file containing the complete, standalone prompt for the mission.

*   **The Mission Runner (`run_missions.sh`):** This shell script acts as the "engine" of the swarm. It reads `missions.json` and executes each mission in sequence. Its key operational phases are:
    1.  **Pre-flight Checks:** Validates `missions.json` and ensures the `main` branch is clean.
    2.  **Git Branch Creation:** Creates a new, unique, timestamped branch for the mission.
    3.  **Aider Invocation:** Runs the `aider` command, feeding it the content of the specified `prompt_file`.
    4.  **Log Monitoring:** Captures all output from the Aider process to a temporary log file.
    5.  **Conditional Commit/Push:** After the Aider process finishes, the script scans the log file for the completion keyword.

*   **The Completion Protocol (`[MISSION_COMPLETE]`):** This keyword is the critical signal for success. An Aider must include this exact string on its own line at the very end of its output to indicate that it has successfully completed its task. The `run_missions.sh` script uses the presence of this keyword to decide whether to commit the Aider's work and push the branch. If the keyword is absent, the script assumes failure, discards the changes, and moves to the next mission.

*   **The `screen` Session:** The `run_missions.sh` script is executed within a `screen` session. This allows the entire autonomous process to run persistently in the background, detached from the Supervisor's terminal. This is crucial for long-running missions and ensures the process is not interrupted if the terminal connection is lost.

## 4. Project History: Where We've Been

The project's initial phase was a "Code Quality Sprint" focused on stabilizing a highly volatile codebase inherited at the start of the project. Following this, a critical debugging phase for the autonomous `run_missions.sh` script was required.

*   **Key Problems & Resolutions:**
    *   **I/O Conflict:** The script initially had issues with state management between sequential Aider runs. This was resolved by wrapping each mission loop in a **subshell**, which isolates the environment for each run.
    *   **`venv` Activation Bug:** A persistent, silent failure was traced to the script's environment not having the `aider` command in its `PATH`. The definitive fix was adding `source venv/bin/activate` to the beginning of the script to ensure the Python virtual environment is always active.
    *   **State Cleanup:** Early failed runs left a large number of stale `feature/auto-*` branches and dead `screen` sessions. A manual cleanup procedure was executed to reset the environment.
*   **Previous Handoff Method:** Prior to the `run_missions.sh` script, continuity was maintained via a manual `SESSION_HANDOFF_LATEST.md` file. This has been superseded by the autonomous system.

## 5. Current Status: Where We Are Now (As of August 04, 2025)

The `run_missions.sh` script has been successfully debugged and launched. It is now autonomously executing the mission queue defined in `missions.json` to build the "Pilot V1" application.

*   **Current Active Mission:** The **Researcher Aider** is processing the `prompts/researcher_child_management_spec.txt` prompt to create the functional specification for the Child Management feature.
*   **Queued Missions:** The following missions are queued up in `missions.json`:
    1.  **Designer Aider:** Create mockups for Child Management.
    2.  **Engineer Aider:** Implement the Child Management feature (API and UI).

## 6. The Roadmap: Where We're Going

*   **Immediate Goal: "Pilot V1" Completion.** The primary objective is the successful, fully autonomous completion of the entire "Pilot V1" feature set by the Aider Swarm. This will serve as the ultimate validation of our current methodology and toolchain.

*   **Mid-Term Goal (Phase 2): The "Foreman Aider".** The next evolution is to introduce a "Foreman" agent. The Supervisor will give the Foreman a high-level objective (e.g., "Implement a billing and subscription system"). The Foreman will then be responsible for autonomously generating the `missions.json` manifest and all the detailed `prompt_file`s for the other Aiders. This abstracts away the manual task of writing detailed mission plans.

*   **Long-Term Goal (Phase 3): The "Conductor Aider".** The ultimate goal of Project Bruno. The Conductor will be a master agent that replaces the `run_missions.sh` script entirely. It will handle the full lifecycle: receiving a business goal, planning the mission sequence (acting as the Foreman), dispatching tasks to the swarm, monitoring for errors, orchestrating retries, and providing high-level progress reports to the Supervisor.
