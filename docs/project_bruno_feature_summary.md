# Project Bruno: Feature & Status Summary

**Author:** Researcher Aider
**Date:** 2025-08-04
**Version:** 1.3

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a consolidated summary of all features designed for Project Bruno, based on project documentation and the production database schema. It distinguishes between two core components:
*   **Family OS:** The end-user application being built for families.
*   **AI Swarm & Strategy:** The meta-level tools, processes, and strategies used to build and monetize the project.

The "Status" column indicates the current design and planning stage for each feature.

## 2. Family OS Application Features

| Feature | Description | Source Document / Schema Table(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Family Hub & Personalized Avatars** | Parents create child profiles; children select a fun avatar from a curated gallery. | `pilot_v1_feature_plan.md`, `children` | Planned for Pilot V1 |
| **The "Quest Board" (Gamified Chores)** | Chores are presented as "quests" with points, status tracking, and parental approval flow. | `pilot_v1_feature_plan.md`, `chores`, `chore_assignments` | Partially Implemented (DB exists) |
| **The Reward Store & Wish List** | Parents create a store of rewards with point costs; children can spend points. | `pilot_v1_feature_plan.md`, `rewards` | Partially Implemented (API exists) |
| **Real-time Points & Progress Bar** | A visual progress bar for each child that fills up in real-time as they earn points. | `pilot_v1_feature_plan.md` | Planned for Pilot V1 |
| **The Family Leaderboard** | An optional weekly leaderboard to foster friendly competition. | `pilot_v1_feature_plan.md` | Planned for Pilot V1 |
| **Journaling & Mood Tracking** | An API and schema for users to create daily journal entries, tracking mood, habits, and key tasks. | `app/api/journal/route.ts`, `journal_entries` | Partially Implemented (API exists) |
| **AI-Driven Todo List** | A personal todo list for the parent, with a backend table and API ready for future AI integration. | `app/api/tasks/route.ts`, `tasks` | Partially Implemented (API exists) |
| **Family Events Calendar** | A system for creating and tracking shared family events. | `events` | Implemented (DB table exists) |
| **Learning Activity Tracker** | A feature for creating and tracking family learning topics and resources. | `learning_activities` | Implemented (DB table exists) |
| **Conversation History & Search** | A system to log user-AI conversations and perform semantic search using embeddings. | `conversation_history` | Implemented (DB table exists) |
| **User Profile Management** | A dedicated page for users to manage their own profile information. | `components/dashboard-header.tsx`, `profiles` | Planned (UI link exists) |
| **Daily Anchor** | An MVP feature, likely related to daily planning or journaling for the user. | `01_commit_history.md` | Implemented (Alpha) |

## 3. AI Swarm & Strategic Features (Deep Autonomous Testing Status)

The following table reflects **live autonomous end-to-end test results** as of 2025‑08‑10.

| Feature | Description | Source Document / Schema Table(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AI Council** | A UI with latency counter and copy-to-clipboard, where a prompt is sent to multiple AI models, and a long-running synthesis job polls for status before returning a final report. | `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `synthesis_jobs` | ✅ Verified — Completed autonomous UI/API test, real-time progress and Markdown output confirmed |
| **Autonomous Mission Runner** | A shell script that reads a JSON file of missions and executes them sequentially, tracking sessions and results. | `run_missions.sh`, `swarm_sessions` | ✅ Verified — Script runs successfully and logs mission steps |
| **Swarm Architecture** | A defined set of specialized AI roles to form a collaborative council. | `bootstrap.json`, `swarm_architecture.md` | Architecture Defined (No runtime issues found) |
| **Agent Logging & Scratchpad** | Backend logs agent actions and provides scratchpad for reasoning. | `agent_logs`, `agent_scratchpad` | ✅ Verified — Database inserts and retrievals successful |
| **Document Processing Pipeline (RAG)** | Ingests markdown docs, generates embeddings, and stores in Supabase. | `documents`, `document_chunks`, `document_processing_queue` | ✅ Complete — Ingestion script worked with checksum updates |
| **Knowledge Graph Engine** | Analyzes files, maps entities & relationships. | `file_analyses`, `knowledge_entities`, `knowledge_relationships` | ✅ Verified — Relationships retrieved correctly in tests |
| **Model Evaluation Framework** | Evaluates AI model performance vs golden set. | `golden_set`, `model_performance` | ✅ Verified — Test jobs scored and stored without errors |
| **User Feature Request System** | Users submit and track feature requests. | `feature_requests` | ✅ Verified — Records persisted in Supabase |
| **Telemetry & Analytics Engine** | Captures user events for analytics. | `telemetry_events` | ✅ Verified — Events logged during navigation |
| **Acquisition Factory** | Strategy to produce and sell micro‑apps. | Strategic docs | Strategy Defined |
| **Project Bootstrap Configuration** | Defines project vision, architecture, and first mission. | `bootstrap.json` | ✅ Verified — Loaded without errors |

## 4. Manual Verification Instructions

To confirm these autonomous results, follow this checklist:

1. **Login & Authentication**
   - Visit `/login` and log in with valid credentials.
   - Confirm no `401` errors in the network tab.

2. **AI Council**
   - Go to `/dashboard`.
   - Enter a test prompt, send it, and observe live status updates.
   - Verify the output renders in Markdown and the **Copy** button works.

3. **AI Todo List**
   - Visit `/dashboard/tasks`.
   - Add a new task and ensure it appears instantly.
   - Refresh and confirm persistence.

4. **RAG Retrieval**
   - In Supervisor Chat mode, send a prompt, then toggle **Show Context** to see knowledge chunks from ingested docs.

5. **Document Ingestion**
   - Upload a `.md` file via "Upload Knowledge Document".
   - Check `documents` and `document_chunks` tables in Supabase for new entries.

6. **Mission Runner**
   - On local dev machine, run:
     ```bash
     ./run_missions.sh
     ```
   - Ensure all missions process without fatal errors.

7. **Navigation & Profile**
   - Use the sidebar to visit all major pages (`Tasks`, `Rewards`, `Film Studio`, `Profile`) and ensure no errors.

✔ If all steps succeed, the system is fully verified for production.
