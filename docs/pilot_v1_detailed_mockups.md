### 2.1. Main View: Today's Entry

This is the default view when navigating to `/journal`. It presents a clean interface for creating or editing the current day's entry.

-   **Layout:** A two-panel layout on desktop.
    -   **Left Panel:** A calendar for navigating past entries.
    -   **Right Panel:** The main editor for the selected day's entry. On mobile, the calendar collapses or is a separate view.
-   **Header:** "Journal" with a primary action button "View All Entries".
-   **Editor Panel Title:** Defaults to the current date, e.g., "August 3, 2025".

#### 2.1.1. Mood Tracker Component
-   **Placement:** At the top of the editor panel.
-   **Interaction:** A row of 5 emoji faces, from sad to happy. The selected emoji has a colored glow (using the accent gradient) and is slightly larger.
    -   `ðŸ˜” ðŸ˜Ÿ ðŸ™‚ ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜„`
-   **Label:** "How was your day?"

#### 2.1.2. Habit Tracker Component

#### 2.1.3. Main Text Area
-   **Style:** A large, clean `Textarea` component with no border, allowing for distraction-free writing.
-   **Prompt:** A subtle, inspiring prompt is shown if the text area is empty, e.g., "What's on your mind today?"

#### 2.1.4. Save Action
-   A "Save Entry" button is located at the bottom of the panel. It shows a loading spinner during the save operation and a checkmark on success.

### 2.2. Browse View: Calendar

-   **Interaction:** Clicking a date on the calendar in the left panel loads that day's entry into the editor panel.
-   **Style:**
    -   Dates with entries are visually marked with a small dot.
    -   The currently selected date is highlighted with a circular background.
    -   The current day has a distinct border color.

    -   **Actions:** A `DropdownMenu` (`MoreHorizontal` icon) with options: "Chat", "Rename", "Delete". The "Chat" option is only enabled for `Ready` documents.

### 3.2. Chat Interface (`/documents/[docId]/chat`)

-   **Header:** Clearly indicates which document is being chatted with: "Chat with `Family_Vacation_Itinerary.pdf`".
-   **Message Display:**
    -   User messages are right-aligned.
