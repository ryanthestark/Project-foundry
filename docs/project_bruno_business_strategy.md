# Project Bruno: Optimal Business Strategy & Financial Forecast

**Prepared by:** Strategy & Growth Ops Team  
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Version:** 1.2 (Updated with Immediate Consulting GTM Plan)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Project Bruno consists of two interconnected pillars:

1. **Family OS** – A B2C mobile-first, PWA-based “family productivity hub” for tasks, chores, rewards, learning, and AI assistance.
2. **AI Swarm Foundry** – A B2B/B2C meta-platform (Mycelia concept) enabling rapid creation of specialized SaaS micro-products leveraging the same AI + RAG + Swarm infrastructure.

Our hybrid go-to-market strategy aims to **generate predictable MRR** from Family OS while **infusing immediate cash flow through consulting services**.

**Decision Point – Week 1 Next Steps:**
- If our goal is $20k/mo in under 30 days, **consulting is the faster path**.
- A W2 role is lower risk, fixed income, but may compete for focus/time.
- Immediate plan: dedicate a 4-week sprint to land at least **2 consulting deals**. If no traction, pivot to sourcing W2.

Target outcomes:  
- $300k–$500k ARR in 12 months to sustain family + platform growth.
- $20k–$40k/mo consulting revenue to bridge to full SaaS scale.
- Long term: $3M–$5M ARR by Year 5, $15M–$50M exit value.

## 2. Immediate Consulting Revenue Plan

### GTM Action Plan (Week-by-Week)

**Week 1 – Prep & Outreach**
1. Create dedicated "Hire Us" page with offers, pricing tiers, case studies.
2. Update LinkedIn profile + banner to reflect new consulting offer.
3. Build lead list of 50 high-value target companies or decision makers:
   - SMBs with complex processes (law, finance, consulting, medtech).
   - Scaling SaaS companies that want AI features without hiring.
   - Training/education orgs for AI-assisted personalization/search.
4. Craft personalized outreach (email + LinkedIn DM) with offer & CTA.
5. Post 3x/week on LinkedIn/Twitter showing demos & thought leadership.

**Week 2 – Engage & Demo**
1. Schedule **free 30-min diagnostic calls** with prospects.
2. Deliver value in call by identifying high-ROI AI opportunities.
3. Offer clear 2–4 week paid pilot proposal ($10k–$20k).
4. Follow-up relentlessly: aim for signed agreements.

**Week 3 – Close First Deals**
1. Begin delivery for first client(s) immediately.
2. Document process, take screenshots for future marketing.
3. Get video testimonial from early clients.

**Week 4 – Scale Outreach**
1. Run paid LinkedIn ads retargeting connections.
2. Start second wave of outreach with refined pitch.
3. Raise average deal size by 20% based on early proof.

### 2.2 Offer Types
1. **AI System Integration** – $20k–$50k  
   Build custom AI assistants, automate workflows, enhance knowledge work.
2. **RAG Knowledge Base Setup** – $15k–$25k  
   Ingest, structure, and search company data securely.
3. **Custom AI Agent Development** – $25k–$50k  
   Multi-agent swarms for customer support, compliance, or innovation.
4. **AI Transformation Audit** – $5k–$15k

### 2.3 Capacity & Financial Targets (Months 1–3)
- **Capacity**: 2–4 clients concurrently (40–60% personal time commitment).
- **Month 1 target**: 2 clients × $10k = $20k.  
- **Month 2–3 target**: 3–4 clients × $12.5k avg = $37.5k–$50k/mo.

---

## 3. Considering W2 Alternative
If within 4 weeks we do not land ≥2 clients:
- Shift focus to sourcing executive/lead AI engineer roles.
- Target $250k+ comp to meet baseline family needs and fund product.

Pros of W2:
- Predictable cash.
- Benefits.
- Lower stress.  
Cons:
- Less time for startup scale.
- No equity upside unless negotiated.

## 4. Summary Recommendation
Pursue aggressive consulting push starting **next week**:
- Update web assets, LinkedIn, and collateral by Tuesday.
- Begin outreach by Wednesday.
- Land 2 signed contracts by Day 28.

If consulting fails to generate ≥$20k/mo within 4 weeks, **pivot** to W2 search.
