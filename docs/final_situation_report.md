## 1. Mission Outcome

- **Mission Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Test Feature Live:** Yes  
- **Details:** The "Deploy, Test, and Handover" mission was successfully completed. The system deployed to production using `vercel --prod`. A MissionPlan for "Add Supervisor Chat link to Dashboard Header" was submitted via the live dashboard UI. The orchestrator processed the steps (Develop → Critique → Synthesize → Deploy), and the UI update is now visible in the production environment. The Supervisor Chat link appears in the dashboard header's user dropdown menu with the correct icon and styling.

## 2. System Status

Final status check on all critical components:

- **API Endpoints**
  - `/api/synthesize/start_critique`: Operational in production after verification and redeployment.
- **Core Orchestrator** (Supabase Edge Function): Operational — successfully processed multi-step MissionPlan jobs and updated job statuses accurately.
- **Dashboard UI** (Primary Control Interface): Operational — handled MissionPlan JSON submission, polled job status, and displayed final synthesized report.
- **Aider Self-Enhancement** (`@post_command_summary` Decorator): Operational — outputs status summary after each command execution.

## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps

**Conclusion:**  
The Mycelia AI Foundry is now fully operational. All major coding and integration tasks are complete, the orchestrator and dashboard UI are connected, and the system can autonomously execute multi-step development missions from human input to deployment.

**Next Steps:**  
- **Step 1:** Ready to accept the first official mission from the Human Supervisor.  
- **Step 2:** Monitor orchestration logs and Supabase job table for early anomaly detection.  
- **Step 3:** Incrementally introduce more complex MissionPlans, including multi-branch and parallelized tasks.
