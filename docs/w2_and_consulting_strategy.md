## **Objective**
Design a combined operational model that:
1. **Streamlines W2 role management** — making overemployment sustainable at the ~145 hrs/month cap while improving reporting and forecasting.
2. **Directly generates a sellable AI consulting deliverable** — a repeatable GTM optimization system that leverages the same tooling/methods.

## **Part 1 — W2 Role Operational Efficiency Layer**

### Problems Identified (from `docs/sales/` analysis):
- Manual tracking of ramp timelines, income, and stress in spreadsheets.
- No automated “hours-to-income” ROI dashboard per role.
- Context switching eats into consulting time.

### AI‑Enabled W2 Ops Enhancements:
| Capability | Description | Data Source | Impact |
|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Dynamic Ramp Tracker** | AI-driven dashboard that auto-tracks ramp phases (start, projected end, current hours, income trend) and highlights underperforming roles in real time. | Supabase `roles` schema + automated ingestion of `docs/sales` time/income logs. | Ensures quick drop/add of roles for max yield and severance capture; enables proactive decision-making to maximize revenue per hour. |
| **Revenue/Hour Optimizer** | Real-time calculation of hourly rate per role vs stress/load; integrates AI suggestions for reallocating high-value activities. | Supabase + manual stress scoring + automated income/hour calc from uploaded CSVs/Sheets. | Directly increases revenue/hour by cutting low-value work and doubling down on proven high-yield patterns. |
| **AI-Generated Intake/Exit Playbooks** | Instantly generates onboarding/offboarding checklists, key contact scripts, and 30/60/90 day action plans for each role. | Stored playbook templates sourced from `docs/sales`. | Reduces non-revenue ramp time for new roles and preserves value from endings. |
| **Unified Performance Log with Sales AI Chat** | Centralized notes/todo per role with integrated AI chat that surfaces insights, next steps, and upsell opportunities. | Supabase document ingestion (`docs/sales/role_notes` + consulting deliverables). | AI chat acts as a personal SDR/AE assistant, increasing speed from note to action, improving close rates, and directly impacting income/hour. |

## **Part 2 — Initial AI Consulting Deliverable (GTM Optimization System)**

### Rationale:
The GTM workflow improvements built for personal W2 work are nearly identical to what high‑ticket consulting clients need:
- Structured onboarding.
- Revenue per rep maximization.
- AI‑enhanced pipeline analytics.
- Stress/load vs yield optimization.

### Consulting Deliverable Package:
**Name:** *AI-Powered GTM Efficiency Blueprint*  
**Format:** 3‑Week Sprint ($15k) or 3‑Month Retainer ($20–30k/month)

**Components:**
1. **Client Ramp Analyzer** — Models expected yield of new hires, identifies ramp optimization points.
2. **GTM Role ROI Dashboard** — Mirrors internal W2 dashboard, tracking SDR/AE yield, cost/hour, stress proxies.
3. **Playbook Generator** — AI system that outputs onboarding, pipeline build, and exit mitigation checklists.
4. **Meeting/Call Summarizer with Action Extraction** — Direct link between internal AI assistant and CRM updates.
5. **Strategic “Load Balance” Module** — Advises on when to add headcount vs optimize existing pipeline load.

## **Implementation Plan (Shared Infra for W2 & Consulting)**

### Phase 0 — Schema Alignment
- Expand `roles` table to include:  
  - `hours_tracked_monthly` (numeric)  
  - `hourly_rate_calc` (numeric, auto‑updated)  
  - `stress_score` (int 1–5)  
- Add `role_activity_logs` table for daily/weekly notes.
- Build ingestion route for `.csv`/`.md` time logs into Supabase.

### Phase 1 — Internal W2 Dashboard
- `/dashboard/roles` — Tracks all W2 roles in grid + charts.
- Auto‑update cost/hour + yield.
- Embed AI Chat widget in dashboard for real-time question answering, account research, and next-step recommendations to reps.

### Phase 2 — Extract Consulting Product
- Duplicate `/dashboard/roles` → `/dashboard/client-gtm` for external clients.
- White‑label with client team data in place of personal W2 roles.
- Activate AI playbook generation per client.
- Provide sales reps with AI Chat front end for GTM dashboards to instantly retrieve best practices, objection handling scripts, and ICP targeting adjustments.
- Use ingested `docs/sales` assets (templates, trackers, calculators) as baseline deliverables for consulting GTM dashboards.

## **Synergy Map**

| Asset Built for W2 Ops | Client‑Facing Deliverable |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Ramp Tracker           | Client Onboarding/Time‑to‑Quota Reduction |
| ROI & Load Balancer    | ROI Analysis for SDRs/AEs |
| Intake/Exit Playbooks  | Role Lifecycle Playbooks |
| Unified Performance Log| GTM War Room Knowledge Base |

---

**Next Step Recommendation:**  
Start Phase 0 schema + backend work **this week** so both personal W2 operations and first consulting engagement run on the same code & data structures. This ensures every improvement to your own role management becomes billable IP for clients.
