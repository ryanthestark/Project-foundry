# Internal Report: Meta-Strategy & Performance Analysis

**To:** The Supervisor
**From:** Chief of Staff
**Date:** 2025-08-04
**Subject:** Analysis of Swarm Economics and Performance, and the "Foreman Aider" Brief

## Part 1: The "Economics of Autonomy" Report

To mature as a business, we must understand the cost of our primary manufacturing process: autonomous software development. This requires a framework for tracking the "Token Economics" of our Aider Swarm.

**Proposed Methodology:**

1.  **Instrument the `aider` Tool:** The `aider` command-line tool must be modified to output the total prompt tokens and completion tokens used upon exiting a session. This should be a standard, machine-readable output.
2.  **Enhance the Mission Runner:** The `run_missions.sh` script must be updated to capture this token information from the Aider's output log.
3.  **Create a Cost Model:** We will maintain a simple internal model with the current costs per million tokens for our primary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o prompt/completion, Claude 3 Opus prompt/completion).
4.  **Log Mission Costs:** After each mission, the runner script will calculate the total cost of the mission (`(prompt_tokens * cost_per_prompt_token) + (completion_tokens * cost_per_completion_token)`) and log it.
5.  **Future Database Schema:** A `mission_costs` table should be created to store this data systematically:
    *   `mission_id` (linking to `missions.json` index or a future UUID)
    *   `aider_name` (text)
    *   `branch_name` (text)
    *   `prompt_tokens` (integer)
    *   `completion_tokens` (integer)
    *   `calculated_cost_usd` (numeric)
    *   `timestamp` (timestamptz)

**Goal:** This system will allow us to answer the critical question: "What was the exact dollar cost to build the 'Child Management' feature?" This data is essential for calculating ROI and pricing our future commercial products.

## Part 2: "Temporal Performance" Analysis & Foreman Brief

### A. Performance Analysis

**Problem:** We currently have poor metrics on the time it takes for the swarm to complete a mission. This "temporal performance" data is critical for forecasting, planning, and creating powerful case studies ("We built and shipped a full-stack feature in 7 hours").

**Best-Effort Analysis of Past Data:**
Based on a manual review of git commit timestamps and session logs, the initial stabilization and feature sprints had highly variable mission times, ranging from 15 minutes for simple spec generation to several hours for complex debugging cycles that required human intervention. This data is too noisy to be reliable.

**Proposed Solution for Robust Logging:**
The `run_missions.sh` script must be immediately updated to log start and end times for every mission.

*   **Implementation:**
    1.  At the beginning of each loop in the subshell, capture the start time: `start_time=$(date +%s)`.
    2.  At the end of the loop, capture the end time: `end_time=$(date +%s)`.
    3.  Calculate the duration: `duration=$((end_time - start_time))`.
    4.  Log the duration in a human-readable format to the main output: `echo "--- Mission completed in $duration seconds. ---"`.
    5.  This data should also be added as a column to the proposed `mission_costs` table.

### B. The "Foreman Aider" Mission Brief

This document defines the requirements for the next major evolution of our autonomous system.

**Mission:** Create the "Foreman Aider," a specialized AI agent that acts as a "planner" and "project manager," bridging the gap between the Supervisor's high-level goals and the Aider Swarm's execution.

**Inputs:**
1.  A single, high-level objective from the Supervisor.
    *   *Example:* `"Implement a complete, end-to-end 'Child Management' feature."*
2.  (Optional) A list of reference documents or existing files for context.

**Core Logic & Workflow:**
1.  **Deconstruction:** The Foreman must first deconstruct the high-level objective into a logical sequence of dependent tasks. For a standard feature, this sequence is:
    *   Task 1: Research & Specification (Researcher Aider)
    *   Task 2: UI/UX Mockups (Designer Aider)
    *   Task 3: Implementation (Engineer Aider)
2.  **Prompt Generation:** For each task in the sequence, the Foreman must generate a complete, detailed, and standalone prompt file. This is its most critical function. It must understand what each specialized Aider needs to succeed.
    *   For the Researcher, it must frame the request as a series of questions to answer.
    *   For the Designer, it must reference the Researcher's output and request specific mockups.
    *   For the Engineer, it must reference both the spec and the mockups and provide a clear implementation plan.
3.  **Manifest Generation:** The Foreman must create a valid `missions.json` file that contains the full sequence of missions it has just planned, including unique branch names and the paths to the prompt files it generated.
4.  **Validation:** Before finishing, the Foreman must validate its own output to ensure the `missions.json` is valid JSON and that all referenced prompt files exist.

**Outputs:**
1.  A `missions.json` file in the root directory.
2.  A set of `prompts/[prompt_name].txt` files.

The successful implementation of the Foreman Aider will represent a major leap in our system's autonomy, abstracting away the need for the Supervisor to write detailed mission briefs.
