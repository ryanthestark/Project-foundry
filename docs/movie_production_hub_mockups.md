## 1. Overview

This document provides high-fidelity UI/UX mockups for the "Movie Production Hub." This hub is the user-facing result of the "Smart Bridge" analysis of a child's creative scriptwriting output. The designs aim to be fun, engaging, and kid-friendly, transforming a raw script into an exciting, manageable family project, while adhering to the established "Pilot V1" visual identity.

## 2. Page Layout: `/hub/[taskId]/review`

The "Movie Production Hub" is a dedicated page that presents the AI's analysis in a visually appealing, dashboard-like format.

-   **Theme:** "Movie Production." The page uses iconography and language related to filmmaking (e.g., "Cast," "Locations," "Props").
-   **Header:** A prominent H1 title, e.g., "Movie Production: The Adventures of Captain Starblaster."
-   **Layout:** A responsive grid of cards. On desktop, this could be a two or three-column layout. On mobile, the cards stack vertically.
-   **Primary Action:** A sticky footer or a prominent button at the end of the page to import the project.

## 3. UI Component Mockups

Each piece of the AI's analysis is presented in its own styled card.

### 3.1. Cast List Card

-   **Icon:** Lucide `Users` icon.
-   **Title:** "The Cast"
-   **Content:** A vertical or horizontal list of identified characters.
-   **Item Style:** Each character is listed next to a placeholder for an avatar. This could be a generic icon initially, with the potential for users to upload or generate a character portrait later.
    -   `[Avatar Placeholder] Captain Starblaster`
    -   `[Avatar Placeholder] Dr. Zorp`
    -   `[Avatar Placeholder] Pirate Pete`

### 3.2. Film Locations Card

-   **Icon:** Lucide `MapPin` icon.
-   **Title:** "Film Locations"
-   **Content:** A grid or list of the distinct scenes identified in the script.
-   **Item Style:** Each location card contains the scene name (e.g., "INT. SPACESHIP - DAY") and a placeholder area for a visual.
-   **Visual Placeholder:** This area will display an AI-generated image suggestion for the scene's backdrop, providing visual inspiration. The image will have a "Regenerate" button.

### 3.3. Prop Department Checklist

-   **Icon:** Lucide `Wrench` icon.
-   **Title:** "Prop Department"
-   **Content:** A checklist of all physical props and costume pieces the AI identified.
-   **Item Style:** Each item is a standard checkbox with a label. This list is for reference and is not directly importable as tasks, but serves as a handy guide.
    -   `[ ] a treasure map`
    -   `[ ] a pirate hat`
    -   `[ ] a laser sword`

### 3.4. Director's To-Do List

This is the primary interactive component on the page.

-   **Icon:** Lucide `ClipboardList` icon.
-   **Title:** "Director's To-Do List"
-   **Description:** "Select the tasks you want to add to your family's chore board."
-   **Content:** A list of actionable tasks generated by the AI.
-   **Item Style:** Each item is a checkbox with a descriptive label. The checkboxes are checked by default. Users can uncheck any tasks they don't want to import.
    -   `[x] Assign roles for Captain Starblaster and Dr. Zorp.`
    -   `[x] Find a cardboard box to build the spaceship set.`
    -   `[x] Make the treasure map prop.`
    -   `[x] Practice lines for Scene 1.`

### 3.5. Primary Action Button

-   **Placement:** Located at the bottom of the "Director's To-Do List" card or in a sticky footer.
-   **Style:** A large, primary action button using the accent gradient defined in the visual identity guide.
-   **Text:** "Import Project to Task Board"
-   **Icon:** Lucide `PlusCircle` icon to the left of the text.
-   **Interaction:** Clicking this button takes all the *checked* items from the "Director's To-Do List" and adds them to the main task management system (`/chores`), where they can be assigned, scheduled, and tracked like any other task.
